# BIN.TAG.PERSON_HEAD_DEVREL

**Operator:** `TAG.PERSON_HEAD_DEVREL` · **layer:** DEEP_TAG · **class:** TAG · **parent:** PEOPLE
**Crate:** `aria-res-tag-person-head-devrel` · **verify:** True · **result:** `residual.tag.person_head_devrel`

## Why

Listed Binary Repository v1 identity. Independent calculation; no borrowed scores.

## Function

Tag operator. Does not name a new entity. Tags or reads an existing node. Role-tags (BUYER/COMPETITOR/…) require the specific tag on the record.

## Use

`work --binary BIN.TAG.PERSON_HEAD_DEVREL` or `work --json` with `ops: ["BIN.TAG.PERSON_HEAD_DEVREL"]`

Production callback: working vertical or nothing. Forget is not delete — original payload stays in `source`.

## Maps that consume this
