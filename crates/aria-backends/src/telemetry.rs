//! T6 — the callable telemetry transform. This is the whole product in one
//! function.
//!
//! ```text
//! Node(payload, config, seed) = E( I(payload, config), Run_Φ(config, seed), Obs )
//! ```
//!
//! [`transform`] *is* that composition, evaluated left to right exactly once:
//!
//! ```text
//! validate limits → ingest (Init) → node profile → run with G₀
//!   → project IPO → tag → receipt → validate envelope → return
//! ```
//!
//! # What this function is not
//!
//! It holds no network client, no database driver, no credential, and no
//! clock. It writes no file — it *returns a value*, and the caller decides
//! where bytes land. Those are not stylistic choices:
//!
//! - No socket or driver means Aria **cannot** write host accepted state, so
//!   it cannot become a second command authority however it is called (L7).
//! - No clock means the envelope can hash equal twice, which is the only way
//!   byte-determinism (L4) is achievable at all.
//! - No sink means a failed run cannot leave a partial envelope behind (L8).
//!
//! `scripts/check_telemetry_boundary.sh` enforces all three by grep.
//!
//! # Where Aria sits
//!
//! A TRACN/PCVC worker binary calls this after a Coordinator released it,
//! inside a sealed Observation Plan. The return value is a *proposal* the
//! Supervisor and the API may read and need not believe. Trust, Use, and Goal
//! completion stay with the authorized human. Nothing here assigns them, and
//! the envelope has no field in which to try.
