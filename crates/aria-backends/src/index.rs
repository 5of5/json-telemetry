//! Deterministic vector index — ℙ5 `O(log |V|)` metric retrieval, ℂ3.
//!
//! [`VectorIndex`] is the seam the plan (WS3 item 3) puts between the Match
//! policy and whatever structure answers "which existing node is nearest to
//! this latent?". The index is **policy layer**: it proposes candidates, it
//! never decides admissibility. A merge only happens after the caller
//! re-verifies the candidate distance against τ in the same compensated f64
//! arithmetic the rest of the engine uses, so an approximate (or even wrong)
//! candidate can change *which* admissible edit is proposed, never *whether*
//! the result satisfies Inv3.
//!
//! # Why this is implemented in-repo (WS3 §0 decision gate)
//!
//! Both third-party candidates the plan named were audited and rejected on
//! measured evidence (CHANGELOG 2026-08-13 INSIGHT):
//!
//! - `instant-distance` 0.6.1 — does not compile for
//!   `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (`getrandom` 0.2 `compile_error!`; the crate
//!   links it unconditionally because its default seed path is
//!   `rand::random()`), and its public API has **no** incremental `insert`:
//!   a Match-per-step workload must rebuild, measured at 85.99 s for the
//!   first 1024 inserts alone.
//! - `hnsw_rs` 0.3.4 — has incremental `insert` but fails the same wasm32
//!   wall (`getrandom` 0.3) and additionally pulls `mmap-rs`/`libc`.
//!
//! The only wasm escape for either is `getrandom`'s JS backend, i.e. OS/JS
//! entropy, which the repo forbids (every backend is seeded explicitly so the
//! same code runs on `wasm32` and so runs are reproducible). `usearch` stays
//! wired as the spec-normative §5.3 engine behind a native-only feature.
//!
//! [`HnswIndex`] therefore implements Malkov & Yashunin's Hierarchical
//! Navigable Small World graph (arXiv:1603.09320 — bibliography
//! `graphs-partitioning-retrieval.md`) directly, with three properties the
//! crates could not offer together:
//!
//! 1. **`f64` end-to-end.** Both crates compute distances in `f32`. Aria's
//!    embeddings, the τ merge threshold and Inv3 are `f64`; ranking candidates
//!    in a narrower arithmetic than the decision consuming them is avoidable
//!    imprecision.
//! 2. **Deterministic by construction.** Single-threaded insertion (no
//!    work-stealing), the repo's seeded MMIX LCG for level draws, the pure-Rust
//!    `libm` logarithm (WS2's parity rule — the host libm differs between
//!    execution environments by ulps), and a *total* order on candidates
//!    `(distance, internal index)` so no tie is ever broken by hash iteration
//!    order.
//! 3. **`wasm32`-clean.** No entropy, no threads, no `libc`.
//!
//! # Parameters
//!
//! Defaults mirror the spec §5.3 normative `usearch` configuration:
//! `connectivity = 16`, `expansion_add = 128`, `expansion_search = 64`.
